# TiVa_Repl
Python codes for replicating OECD TiVa indicators from their ICIO tables (for 2021 Nov Release)

You need to first download the OECD IO table in the CSV format, from oe.cd/icio

Attention: this is from my own interests and not from OECD itself! So no rights can be derived from these codes...
